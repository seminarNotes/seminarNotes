ðŸ‘‹ Hello! 

Nice to meet you. I am currently studying data engineering and have experience as a numerical analysis developer for the past few years.

In addition to data engineering and quant development, I have a broad interest in various programming languages and theories. I strive to find better solutions through exploration and learning of new technologies and tools.

As a developer open to opportunities for communication and sharing, I look forward to the chance to grow and learn together. Please feel free to reach out at any time.

Thank you!
